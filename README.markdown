![GitHub CI](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/inspolicious/actions/workflows/vue.yml/badge.svg)

***A small Vue.js app to inspire writers.*** :black_nib: :ribbon:

## ABOUT :books:

I recently wanted to dive into Node.js and all of its projects and frameworks. I have been playing around with Vue.js for some time now and finally seriously decided to make a project using Vue.js. This project is a word generator for creative people. So if maybe you need some words or ideas for a seed of an idea for a story or an artwork, this generator gives you a random bunch of words. To use this tool, simply click the link for the deployed version of ***Inspolicious***. Enjoy. :heart:
